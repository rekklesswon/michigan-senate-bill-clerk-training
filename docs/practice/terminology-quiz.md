## Scenario-Based Questions (5 questions)

What happened?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

### Scenario Question 2

Why did it fail?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The bill needed **20 votes** (majority of 38) to pass. It received only 19 votes, so it **failed**. (Note: If it were truly 19-19, the Lt. Governor could break the tie, but with 38 total, ties are actually rare. This would mean senators absent or not voting.)
</details>

### Scenario Question 3
"Message from House: House passed Senate Bill 567 with amendments. Senator Martinez moves to concur. Roll call: Yeas 21, Nays 17. What happens next?"

<details>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Bill **PASSED** (30 votes, needs 20) ✓
