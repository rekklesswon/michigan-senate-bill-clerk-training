## Overview: From Idea to Law

Becoming a law in Michigan is deliberately difficult. The process includes multiple checkpoints, readings, and votes to ensure thorough review. Most bills do NOT become law. Understanding each stage helps Bill Clerks accurately track and code bill status.

**Key Numbers to Remember:**
- **3 readings** required for each bill
- **5 days** bill must be available before final passage (five-day rule)
- **20 votes** needed for passage (majority of 38)
- **26 votes** needed for immediate effect (2/3 of 38)
- **90 days** after session adjournment: when laws take effect without immediate effect clause

---

## The Complete Bill Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Introduction (First Reading)

**What Happens:**
- A Senator sponsors a bill and files it with the Secretary of the Senate
- Bill receives a number (SB 1, SB 2, etc., in order of introduction)
- Bill is read by title (or just the bill number) on the Senate floor
- This is the **First Reading**
- Bill is printed and made available to legislators and public

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code bill as "introduced"
- Note the sponsor(s) and date
- Record first reading

**Example:**
"Senate Bill 143, sponsored by Senator Jones, a bill to amend the vehicle code regarding electric vehicles. First reading."

**Note:** Sometimes multiple bills are introduced in a batch with quick first readings.

---

### Stage 2: Committee Referral

**What Happens:**
- Immediately after first reading, the President of the Senate (Lt. Governor) refers the bill to a committee
- Referral is based on the bill's subject matter
- Majority Leader has primary influence on committee referrals
- Can be referred to multiple committees (first to one, then to another)

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code which committee receives the bill
- Note date of referral

**Example:**
"Senate Bill 143 is referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure."

**Special Case:**
Bills involving spending usually go to a policy committee first, then to Appropriations Committee.

---

### Stage 3: Committee Action

**What Happens in Committee:**
- Chair decides whether to hold a hearing (not all bills get hearings)
- Public hearings allow testimony from experts, citizens, lobbyists
- Committee members question witnesses and debate bill
- Committee may amend the bill (make changes)
- Committee votes on whether to report bill back to full Senate

**Possible Committee Actions:**

1. **Reported with Recommendation "Do Pass"**
   - Committee approves bill as written
   - Goes to General Orders (Committee of the Whole)

2. **Reported with Recommendation "Do Pass as Amended"**
   - Committee made changes and approves amended version
   - Goes to General Orders

3. **Reported with Substitute (Committee Substitute)**
   - Committee rewrote significant portions
   - Original bill replaced with substitute
   - Goes to General Orders

4. **Referred to Another Committee**
   - Sent to different committee (e.g., policy committee sends to Appropriations)
   - Common for bills with fiscal impact

5. **Postponed**
   - Delayed for future consideration
   - May or may not come back

6. **No Action**
   - Committee never votes on bill
   - Bill effectively dies in committee
   - **Most bills die this way**

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code committee action accurately
- Note any amendments or substitutes
- Record date of committee report

**Example:**
"The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reports Senate Bill 143 with recommendation 'do pass as amended.'"

**Timeline Note:** Committees meet on their own schedule. A bill can sit in committee for weeks, months, or forever.

---

### Stage 4: General Orders (Committee of the Whole) - Second Reading

**What is General Orders?**
- "Committee of the Whole" means the entire Senate acts as one big committee
- Less formal than Third Reading
- This is where most debate and amendments happen
- Senate can accept committee amendments, add new amendments, or reject amendments
- Sometimes called "Second Reading"

**What Happens:**
- Bill is placed on General Orders calendar
- Sponsor explains bill to full Senate
- Senators debate and offer floor amendments
- Amendments are voted on (often by voice vote)
- Senate votes to advance bill to Third Reading (or not)

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code bill as "on General Orders"
- Record all amendments offered and their outcomes (adopted/defeated)
- Note when bill advances to Third Reading

**Key Point:** Bills can be amended heavily during General Orders. This is the flexible stage.

**Example:**
"Senate Bill 143 is on General Orders. Senator Smith offers Floor Amendment 1. Amendment adopted. Bill advanced to Third Reading."

---

### Stage 5: Five-Day Rule ⏰

**Critical Requirement:**
After a bill is placed on Third Reading calendar, it **must be available in its final form for at least 5 calendar days** before the Senate can take a final vote.

**Purpose:**
- Gives legislators time to read final version
- Allows public to see what will be voted on
- Prevents surprise legislation

**How It Works:**
- Count 5 full calendar days (not session days)
- Includes weekends and holidays
- Bill placed on Third Reading Monday → eligible for final vote Saturday
- Bill placed on Third Reading Friday → eligible for final vote Wednesday

**Exceptions:**
- Can be waived by 2/3 vote of Senate (rare)
- Emergency situations (extremely rare)

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Track when bill placed on Third Reading
- Calculate earliest date for final vote
- Flag if bill is voted on too early (procedural error)

**Common Mistake:** Counting 5 session days instead of 5 calendar days. Always count calendar days!

---

### Stage 6: Third Reading and Final Passage 🗳️

**What Happens:**
- This is the final, formal vote on the bill
- Bill is read by title (Third Reading)
- Limited debate (no amendments allowed without special consent)
- Roll call vote taken
- Each Senator's vote is recorded publicly

**Voting Requirements:**

**For Passage:**
- **20 votes** (majority of 38) required
- If bill receives 20+ votes: **PASSED**
- If bill receives fewer than 20 votes: **DEFEATED**

**For Immediate Effect:**
- If bill is to take effect immediately upon signing (not waiting 90 days)
- Requires **26 votes** (2/3 of 38)
- Separate vote after passage vote
- Requires recorded roll call

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code Third Reading
- Record vote count (Yeas, Nays, Excused, Not Voting)
- Note if bill passed or defeated
- Record immediate effect vote separately if applicable

**Example:**
"Third Reading of Senate Bill 143. The question being on passage of the bill. The bill passed, Yeas 32, Nays 6. Immediate effect? Yeas 28, Nays 10. Immediate effect granted."

**Result:** Bill passed and will take effect immediately when Governor signs.

---

### Stage 7: Other Chamber (House of Representatives)

**What Happens:**
- Passed Senate bill goes to House
- House goes through same process: first reading, committee referral, committee action, General Orders, Third Reading
- House may pass bill as is, amend it, or defeat it

**Three Possible Outcomes:**

1. **House Passes Bill as Sent from Senate**
   - Identical version passed
   - Bill goes to Governor
   - No further Senate action needed

2. **House Passes Bill with Amendments**
   - House changed the bill
   - Amended version comes back to Senate
   - Senate must decide: concur (agree) or non-concur (disagree)
   - See Stage 8

3. **House Defeats Bill or Takes No Action**
   - Bill dies
   - Senate cannot force House to act

**Bill Clerk Action (Senate Side):**
- Code bill as "sent to House"
- Track when House acts
- Code House passage or amendments

**Timeline:** House process can take weeks or months. Bill Clerks monitor House activity for Senate bills.

---

### Stage 8: Concurrence or Conference Committee

**If House Amends a Senate Bill:**

#### Option A: Senate Concurs
- Senate votes to accept House amendments
- Requires majority vote (20 votes)
- If Senate concurs, bill goes to Governor
- **Bill Clerk Action:** Code "Senate concurred in House amendments"

**Example:**
"The question being on concurrence in House amendments to Senate Bill 143. The Senate concurred. Yeas 24, Nays 14."

#### Option B: Senate Non-Concurs
- Senate rejects House amendments
- Senate can request Conference Committee
- **Bill Clerk Action:** Code "Senate non-concurred in House amendments"

**Example:**
"The question being on concurrence in House amendments to Senate Bill 143. The Senate non-concurred. Senator Jones moves that a Conference Committee be appointed."

#### Conference Committee Process:
- 3 Senators and 3 Representatives appointed
- Committee negotiates compromise between versions
- Produces a **Conference Report**
- Both chambers must approve Conference Report (no amendments allowed)
- If both approve: bill goes to Governor
- If either rejects: bill dies (or new conference committee formed)

**Bill Clerk Action for Conference:**
- Code appointment of conferees
- Track Conference Report
- Record votes on Conference Report in Senate

---

### Stage 9: Governor's Action

**Once Bill Passes Both Chambers in Identical Form:**
Bill is "enrolled" (officially prepared) and sent to Governor.

**Governor Has Three Options:**

#### Option 1: Sign the Bill ✍️
- Governor signs bill into law
- Becomes a **Public Act** (PA)
- Receives PA number (PA 1 of 2026, PA 2 of 2026, etc.)
- Takes effect based on immediate effect vote:
  - **If immediate effect:** Takes effect upon signing
  - **If no immediate effect:** Takes effect 90 days after Legislature adjourns for the year

#### Option 2: Veto the Bill 🚫
- Governor rejects bill
- Sends veto message back to Legislature
- Legislature can override veto with **2/3 vote in both chambers** (26 in Senate, 74 in House)
- Override is rare but possible
- If override succeeds: becomes law without Governor's signature

#### Option 3: Do Nothing (Pocket Veto) ⏱️
- Governor neither signs nor vetoes
- If Legislature is in session: Bill becomes law after 14 days without signature
- If Legislature has adjourned for the year: Bill dies (true pocket veto)

**Bill Clerk Action:**
- Code bill as "enrolled and sent to Governor"
- Track Governor's action
- Record PA number if signed
- Code veto if applicable
- Track override attempts

## Common Ways Bills Die

Most bills do NOT become law. Here's where they typically fail:

### 1. **Dies in Committee (Most Common)**
   - Committee chair never schedules hearing
   - Committee votes down bill
   - Committee postpones indefinitely
   - **Estimate:** 60-70% of bills die in committee

### 2. **Fails on Third Reading**
   - Cannot get 20 votes for passage
   - Political opposition too strong

### 3. **Fails in Other Chamber**
   - House kills Senate bill (or vice versa)
   - Committee in other chamber blocks bill
   - Other chamber runs out of time

### 4. **Conference Committee Fails**
   - Cannot reach compromise
   - One chamber rejects Conference Report

### 5. **Governor Vetoes**
   - Override attempt fails (need 2/3 in both chambers)

### 6. **Time Runs Out**
   - Legislature adjourns before completing process
   - Bills do not carry over to next session
   - Must be reintroduced in new session

### 7. **Procedural Errors**
   - Five-day rule violated
   - Improper committee referral
   - Constitutional problems discovered

**Key Insight:** The system is designed to make passing laws difficult. This ensures only bills with broad support become law.

## Self-Check Quiz

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 1:</strong> What are the three readings a bill must receive?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **First Reading:** Introduction and assignment to committee
2. **Second Reading:** General Orders (Committee of the Whole) - debate and amendment stage
3. **Third Reading:** Final passage vote

Note: In practice, First Reading is just reading the bill number/title, Second Reading is General Orders, and Third Reading is the final vote.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> A bill is placed on the Third Reading calendar on Monday, March 3. What is the earliest date the Senate can vote on final passage?</summary>

**Answer:** Saturday, March 8 (five full calendar days later). The five-day rule requires 5 calendar days (not session days) to pass before final vote.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 3:</strong> How many votes are needed to pass a bill in the Senate? How many for immediate effect?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- **20 votes** (majority of 38) needed for passage
- **26 votes** (2/3 of 38) needed for immediate effect
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 4:</strong> What happens during General Orders (Committee of the Whole)?</summary>

**Answer:** General Orders is the stage where the full Senate debates the bill and considers amendments. Senators can offer floor amendments, which are voted on. After debate and amendments, the Senate votes to advance the bill to Third Reading. This is a less formal stage than Third Reading.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 5:</strong> The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's options?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **Concur** - Accept the House amendments (requires 20 votes); bill goes to Governor
2. **Non-concur** - Reject the House amendments; typically leads to requesting a Conference Committee to negotiate a compromise
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 6:</strong> What are the three options the Governor has when a bill reaches their desk?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **Sign** - Bill becomes a Public Act (law)
2. **Veto** - Reject the bill (Legislature can override with 2/3 vote)
3. **Do Nothing** - Bill becomes law after 14 days if Legislature is in session; dies if Legislature has adjourned (pocket veto)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 7:</strong> A bill passes the Senate and House with immediate effect. When does the law take effect if the Governor signs it?</summary>

**Answer:** Immediately upon the Governor's signature. The immediate effect clause allows laws to take effect right away instead of waiting 90 days after session ends.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 8:</strong> What is the most common way bills die in the Legislature?</summary>

**Answer:** Dying in committee (no action taken). The committee chair simply never schedules a hearing on the bill, or the committee votes it down. Approximately 60-70% of bills die in committee.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 9:</strong> True or False: If both chambers pass a bill but in different forms, the bill can still go to the Governor.</summary>

**Answer:** False. Both chambers must pass the bill in **identical form** before it goes to the Governor. If the versions differ, the chambers must resolve the differences (through concurrence or conference committee).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 10:</strong> What is a Conference Report and when is it used?</summary>

**Answer:** A Conference Report is a compromise version of a bill created by a Conference Committee (3 Senators + 3 Representatives) when the two chambers pass different versions and cannot reach agreement through concurrence. Both chambers must approve the Conference Report without amendments for the bill to proceed to the Governor.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 11:</strong> Without immediate effect, when do Michigan laws take effect?</summary>

**Answer:** 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the year (sine die adjournment). This is why most bills include immediate effect clauses.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 12:</strong> Can amendments be offered during Third Reading?</summary>

**Answer:** Generally no. Third Reading is for final passage vote only. Amendments are debated and adopted during General Orders (Second Reading). Amendments during Third Reading require special consent, which is rare.
</details>

## Practical Exercise: Track This Bill

**Scenario:** You're a Bill Clerk watching Senate proceedings.

**Senator Williams announces:**
"Mr. President, I introduce Senate Bill 421, to amend the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act regarding wetlands conservation."

**President of Senate:**
"Senate Bill 421, first reading. The bill is referred to the Committee on Natural Resources and Agriculture."

**Two weeks later, Committee Chair announces:**
"The Committee on Natural Resources and Agriculture reports Senate Bill 421 with the recommendation 'do pass as amended' and refers the bill to the Committee on Appropriations."

**Three weeks later, Appropriations Committee reports:**
"The Committee on Appropriations reports Senate Bill 421 with the recommendation 'do pass.'"

**One week later, on General Orders:**
"Senate Bill 421 is before the Senate on General Orders. Senator Williams explains the bill. Senator Jackson offers Floor Amendment 1... Amendment adopted by voice vote. Senator Lee moves the bill be advanced to Third Reading. Motion carried."

**The next day:**
"Senate Bill 421 has been on Third Reading for one day. It is not yet eligible for final vote under the five-day rule."

**Five days later:**
"Third Reading of Senate Bill 421. The question being on passage of the bill. The bill passed, Yeas 28, Nays 10. Senator Williams moves immediate effect. The question being on immediate effect. Yeas 27, Nays 11. Immediate effect is granted."

**Questions for you:**
1. What committees reviewed this bill?
2. How many times was the bill amended (that you can tell)?
3. How many days must pass before Third Reading vote?
4. Did immediate effect pass?
5. What happens next?

<details>
<summary><strong>Answers:</strong></summary>

1. **Two committees:** Natural Resources and Agriculture (policy committee), then Appropriations (fiscal committee)
2. **Twice:** Once in Natural Resources committee ("do pass as amended") and once on General Orders (Floor Amendment 1)
3. **5 calendar days** after being placed on Third Reading
4. **Yes**, immediate effect passed with 27 votes (needs 26)
5. **Bill is sent to the House** for the House to go through its own process (first reading, committee, General Orders, Third Reading)
</details>

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

**Q: What if a bill needs more than 5 days on Third Reading?**  
A: The five-day rule is a minimum. Bills can sit on Third Reading for weeks or months if leadership doesn't schedule the vote.

**Q: Can the five-day rule be waived?**  
A: Yes, but only by 2/3 vote of the Senate, and it's very rare. Usually reserved for true emergencies.

**Q: What happens if the Senate violates the five-day rule?**  
A: The vote can be challenged and ruled invalid. The law could be struck down in court. It's a serious procedural error.

**Q: How do I know if a bill needs to go to Appropriations?**  
A: Listen for fiscal impact statements. If a bill spends state money, it usually goes to Appropriations. Bills often go to policy committee first, then Appropriations.

**Q: What if the House makes dozens of amendments?**
