## The Bicameral Requirement

### Why Two Chambers?

Michigan, like most states and the U.S. Congress, has a **bicameral** (two-chamber) legislature:
- **Michigan Senate:** 38 members, 4-year terms
- **Michigan House:** 110 members, 2-year terms

### The Iron Rule:

**Both chambers must pass IDENTICAL versions of a bill before it can go to the Governor.**

**This means:**
- If Senate passes SB 100 and sends it to House
- If House amends SB 100 before passing it
- The Senate must approve those House amendments
- Or the chambers must negotiate until they agree on identical text

**No exceptions.** This is constitutionally required.

---

## How Bills Move Between Chambers

### Starting Point: Bill Can Originate in Either Chamber

- **Senate Bill (SB):** Starts in Senate
- **House Bill (HB):** Starts in House

**For this module, we'll focus on Senate bills going to the House** (since you'll be working in the Senate).

---

## The Standard Path: Senate Bill to House

### Step 1: Senate Passes Bill

Senate completes full process:
1. Introduction (First Reading)
2. Committee referral and action
3. General Orders (Second Reading)
4. Third Reading (passage with 20+ votes)
5. Immediate effect vote (if applicable)

**Result:** Bill passed by Senate

---

### Step 2: Bill Sent to House

**What happens:**
- Bill transmitted to House with message: "The Senate has passed Senate Bill X"
- House receives bill and begins its own process
- **Completely independent review:** House doesn't rubber-stamp Senate work

**Bill Clerk Action (Senate side):** Code "sent to House" with date

---

### Step 3: House Process

House goes through same stages as Senate (but with House-specific procedures):
1. **First Reading:** Bill introduced in House
2. **Committee Referral:** House leadership assigns to House committee
3. **Committee Action:** House committee reviews (may be different recommendation than Senate committee)
4. **General Orders:** House Committee of the Whole debates and amends
5. **Third Reading:** House final passage vote (needs 56 of 110 votes)

**Timeline:** Can take days, weeks, or months. Some bills never get House hearings.

---

### Step 4: Three Possible House Outcomes

#### Outcome A: House Passes Bill Unchanged ✅

**What happens:**
- House passes Senate bill exactly as received
- No amendments
- **Identical versions** passed by both chambers

**Next step:** Bill goes directly to Governor

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "House passed SB X" (no amendments)

**This is the simplest path!**

---

#### Outcome B: House Passes Bill with Amendments 🔄

**What happens:**
- House changes bill (adds, deletes, or modifies language)
- House passes amended version
- Bill returns to Senate with House amendments

**Next step:** Senate must decide whether to accept House amendments (see Concurrence section below)

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "House passed SB X with amendments"

**This is very common.** Often leads to negotiations.

---

#### Outcome C: House Defeats Bill or Takes No Action ❌

**What happens:**
- House committee never reports bill, or
- House committee reports "do not pass," or
- House votes down bill on floor, or
- House never acts before session ends

**Result:** Bill dies

**Next step:** None (bill is dead)

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "House took no action" or "House defeated SB X"

**Reality check:** Many Senate bills die in House, and vice versa. Each chamber protects its prerogatives.

---

## The Concurrence Process

### What is Concurrence?

**Concurrence** is when one chamber votes to accept the other chamber's amendments.

### When It Happens:

After House passes Senate bill with amendments, amended bill returns to Senate. Senate must vote on whether to **concur** (agree) or **non-concur** (disagree).

---

### Option 1: Senate Concurs (Accepts House Amendments)

**Process:**
1. Presiding officer announces: "Message from the House. The House has passed Senate Bill X with amendments."
2. House amendments read or explained
3. Motion made: "I move the Senate concur in the House amendments to Senate Bill X"
4. Debate (if any)
5. Vote (roll call usually required)
6. If 20+ votes: **Senate concurs**

**Result:**
- Both chambers have now passed identical version
- Bill goes to Governor
- Process complete

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "Senate concurred in House amendments, Yeas [#], Nays [#]"

**Example:**
"The question being on concurrence in the House amendments to Senate Bill 445. Roll call: Yeas 24, Nays 14. The Senate concurs in the House amendments."

---

### Option 2: Senate Non-Concurs (Rejects House Amendments)

**Process:**
1. House amendments announced
2. Motion made: "I move the Senate non-concur in the House amendments to Senate Bill X"
3. Vote
4. If majority votes to non-concur: **Senate non-concurs**

**Result:**
- Senate and House still disagree
- Bill stuck (different versions in each chamber)
- Usually leads to **Conference Committee** request

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "Senate non-concurred in House amendments"

**Why Senate might non-concur:**
- House amendments change policy in unacceptable way
- House amendments too expensive
- House amendments weaken bill
- Political disagreement

**Example:**
"The question being on concurrence in the House amendments to Senate Bill 567. The Senate non-concurs. Senator Martinez moves that a Conference Committee be appointed."

---

## Conference Committees

### What is a Conference Committee?

A **Conference Committee** is a joint Senate-House committee created to negotiate a compromise when the chambers pass different versions of a bill.

### Composition:

- **3 Senators** (appointed by Senate Majority Leader or President)
- **3 Representatives** (appointed by House Speaker)
- Usually includes bill sponsors and senior members
- Typically reflects party balance (e.g., 2 majority, 1 minority from each chamber)

---

### Conference Committee Process:

#### 1. **Appointment**
- Senate non-concurs and requests conference committee
- Senate appoints 3 conferees
- House agrees and appoints 3 conferees
- 6-member committee formed

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code "Conference Committee requested" and names of Senate conferees

---

#### 2. **Negotiation**
- 6 members meet privately
- Negotiate compromise between Senate and House versions
- Can take hours, days, or weeks
- No public hearings (closed-door negotiations)
- Try to find middle ground both chambers will accept

---

#### 3. **Conference Report**
- Committee produces **Conference Report** - compromise version of bill
- Report explains changes made
- Conference Report must be signed by majority of conferees from each chamber (2 of 3 Senators, 2 of 3 Representatives)

---

#### 4. **Both Chambers Vote**
- Conference Report sent to both Senate and House
- Each chamber votes **up or down** on Conference Report
- **No amendments allowed** - must accept or reject as written
- Requires majority in each chamber (20 in Senate, 56 in House)

**Possible outcomes:**

**Both chambers adopt Conference Report ✅**
- Bill has now passed both chambers in identical form (the Conference Report version)
- Bill goes to Governor
- Success!

**One or both chambers reject Conference Report ❌**
- Bill fails (or new conference committee appointed)
- Rare but happens

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code Senate vote on Conference Report: "Senate adopted Conference Report on SB X, Yeas [#], Nays [#]"

---

## Real-World Example: Bill Ping-Pong

**Senate Bill 789: School Safety Funding**

**Act 1: Senate Action**
- **Original Senate version:** $100 million for school security equipment, distributed equally to all districts
- Senate passes SB 789: Yeas 30, Nays 8
- Immediate effect granted
- Sent to House

**Act 2: House Changes**
- House Education Committee amends bill:
  - Reduces funding to $75 million
  - Changes distribution formula (based on enrollment, not equal)
  - Adds reporting requirements for districts
- House passes SB 789 with amendments: Yeas 68, Nays 42
- Bill returns to Senate with House amendments

**Act 3: Senate Decision Point**
- Senate leadership reviews House amendments
- **Concerns:** 
  - Less money ($75M vs $100M)
  - Distribution formula hurts rural districts
- **Positives:**
  - $75M better than nothing
  - Bill moves forward
- **Decision:** Try to negotiate better deal

**Act 4: Non-Concurrence and Conference Committee**
- Senate votes to **non-concur** in House amendments: Yeas 25, Nays 13
- Senate requests Conference Committee
- **Senate conferees appointed:** Senators Martinez (sponsor), Lee (Education Chair), Johnson (Minority)
- **House conferees appointed:** Reps. Brown (sponsor), Davis (Education Chair), Wilson (Minority)

**Act 5: Conference Negotiations**
- 6 conferees meet over 2 days
- **Compromise reached:**
  - **$85 million** (split the difference)
  - **Hybrid distribution formula:** 50% equal, 50% enrollment-based (helps both rural and urban)
  - **Simplified reporting** requirements (less burdensome than House version)

**Act 6: Conference Report**
- Conference Report drafted and signed by 5 of 6 conferees (1 House member opposed)
- Report sent to both chambers

**Act 7: Both Chambers Vote**
- **Senate vote on Conference Report:** Yeas 28, Nays 10 ✅
- **House vote on Conference Report:** Yeas 71, Nays 39 ✅
- Both chambers adopted!

**Act 8: To Governor**
- Bill enrolled and sent to Governor
- Governor signs bill
- **Becomes PA 124 of 2026**
- Takes effect immediately (IE was granted originally)

**Total time:** 4 months from Senate passage to enactment

**Bill Clerk tracked:** Every step from Senate passage to House message to non-concurrence to Conference Report to final adoption

## Key Differences Between Senate and House

As a Senate Bill Clerk, you'll primarily code Senate actions, but understanding House differences helps you anticipate what happens when Senate bills go to House:

### Structural Differences:

| Feature | Senate | House |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Size** | 38 members | 110 members |
| **Districts** | ~260,000 constituents | ~90,000 constituents |
| **Terms** | 4 years | 2 years |
| **Presiding Officer** | Lt. Governor (President of Senate) | Speaker of the House (elected Representative) |
| **Votes for Passage** | 20 (majority of 38) | 56 (majority of 110) |
| **Votes for Immediate Effect** | 26 (2/3 of 38) | 74 (2/3 of 110) |

---

### Procedural Differences:

| Feature | Senate | House |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Formality** | More formal, slower pace | Less formal, faster pace |
| **Debate** | More leisurely | More restricted time |
| **Committees** | 17 standing committees | ~20 standing committees (similar names) |
| **Seniority** | More emphasis on seniority | Less emphasis on seniority |
| **Party Control** | Leadership has strong control | Leadership has very strong control |

---

### Cultural Differences:

**Senate:**
- Smaller, more collegial
- Senators know each other well
- Longer terms = less electoral pressure
- "Upper chamber" prestige
- More deliberative

**House:**
- Larger, more formal rules needed
- Representatives may not know all colleagues
- 2-year terms = constant campaigning
- More responsive to immediate constituent concerns
- Faster-paced

**Impact on bills:**
- House may move faster on some bills
- Senate may be more deliberative
- Each chamber protects its prerogatives (doesn't like being told what to do)
- Conference committees are where institutional pride meets compromise

---

## Joint Actions and Rules

### Joint Rules:

Some rules govern both chambers:
- How messages are sent between chambers
- Conference committee procedures
- Joint sessions (e.g., Governor's State of the State address)
- Counting electoral votes

### Messages Between Chambers:

**Formal communications:**
- "Message from the House: The House has passed Senate Bill X"
- "Message from the Senate: The Senate requests a Conference Committee"
- Messages read on floor and recorded in Journal

**Bill Clerk Note:** Code when messages are received and Senate's response

---

## Common Reasons Bills Fail Between Chambers

Even if a bill passes one chamber, it may fail in the other:

### 1. **Policy Disagreements**
- Chambers have different priorities
- Party control differs (e.g., Senate majority vs. House majority)

### 2. **Turf Wars**
- House doesn't like Senate telling it what to do (and vice versa)
- Chamber pride and institutional prerogatives

### 3. **Time Constraints**
- Bill passes Senate late in session
- House runs out of time to act

### 4. **Committee Chair Opposition**
- House committee chair opposes bill
- Never schedules hearing

### 5. **Leadership Priorities**
- House leadership focuses on different issues
- Senate bill not a priority

### 6. **Political Maneuvering**
- Bill used as leverage for other negotiations
- Held hostage for unrelated compromises

**Reality:** Only a fraction of bills that pass one chamber pass the other. The bicameral system is a high bar.

## Self-Check Quiz

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 1:</strong> Why must both chambers pass identical versions of a bill?</summary>

**Answer:** This is constitutionally required. Michigan's bicameral system requires both the Senate (38 members) and House (110 members) to pass exactly the same version of a bill before it can be sent to the Governor. This ensures thorough review and broader consensus.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's two main options?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **Concur** - Accept the House amendments (requires 20 votes); bill goes to Governor
2. **Non-concur** - Reject the House amendments; typically leads to requesting a Conference Committee
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 3:</strong> What is a Conference Committee and who serves on it?</summary>

**Answer:** A Conference Committee is a joint Senate-House committee created to negotiate a compromise when chambers pass different versions of a bill. It consists of 3 Senators and 3 Representatives appointed by their respective leaders.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 4:</strong> Can legislators amend a Conference Report?</summary>

**Answer:** No. Conference Reports must be voted up or down as written. No amendments are allowed. Each chamber must accept or reject the entire compromise.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 5:</strong> Senate passes SB 234. House passes SB 234 unchanged. What happens next?</summary>

**Answer:** The bill goes directly to the Governor because both chambers have passed identical versions. No concurrence vote or conference committee needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 6:</strong> How many votes are needed for the Senate to concur in House amendments?</summary>

**Answer:** 20 votes (majority of 38 Senators), same as for passage of a bill.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 7:</strong> What's the difference between Senate and House in terms of size and terms?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- **Senate:** 38 members, 4-year terms
- **House:** 110 members, 2-year terms
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 8:</strong> True or False: If the Senate passes a bill, the House is required to give it a hearing and vote on it.</summary>

**Answer:** False. The House has complete independence. The House committee chair can decline to schedule a hearing, effectively killing the bill. Each chamber controls its own agenda.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 9:</strong> A Conference Committee produces a report. Senate adopts it 25-13, but House rejects it 48-62. What happens?</summary>

**Answer:** The bill fails (at least temporarily). Both chambers must adopt the Conference Report for the bill to proceed. The chambers could appoint a new conference committee to try again, or the bill dies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 10:</strong> Why might the Senate non-concur in House amendments even if the Senate wants the bill to pass?</summary>

**Answer:** The Senate may believe the House amendments are unacceptable (change policy too much, reduce funding, add problematic provisions, etc.) and want to negotiate a better compromise through a Conference Committee rather than accepting the House version.
</details>

## Practice Scenario: Tracking Inter-Chamber Movement

**You're a Bill Clerk. Code the following actions:**

**March 5:** Senate passes SB 678 (education funding bill), Yeas 28, Nays 10. Immediate effect granted, Yeas 27, Nays 11. Bill sent to House.

**April 12:** Message from House: House has passed SB 678 with amendments (changed distribution formula and reduced amount).

**April 15:** Senate debates House amendments. Senator Lee moves Senate non-concur in House amendments. Yeas 24, Nays 14. Senate non-concurs. Senator Lee moves that Conference Committee be appointed. Motion carried.

**April 15:** Senate Majority Leader appoints Senators Lee, Martinez, and Johnson as conferees.

**April 28:** Conference Committee reports compromise version.

**May 2:** Senate considers Conference Report on SB 678. Senator Lee moves Senate adopt Conference Report. Roll call: Yeas 26, Nays 12. Senate adopts Conference Report.

**May 3:** Message from House: House has adopted Conference Report on SB 678.

**May 5:** SB 678 enrolled and sent to Governor.

**May 10:** Governor signs SB 678. Becomes PA 92 of 2026.

<details>
<summary><strong>What key actions did you code?</strong></summary>

**Bill Clerk Coding:**
1. March 5: SB 678 passed Senate (28-10), IE granted (27-11), sent to House
2. April 12: House passed SB 678 with amendments
3. April 15: Senate non-concurred (24-14), Conference Committee requested
4. April 15: Senate conferees appointed (Lee, Martinez, Johnson)
5. May 2: Senate adopted Conference Report (26-12)
6. May 3: House adopted Conference Report
7. May 5: Bill enrolled and sent to Governor
8. May 10: Governor signed, PA 92 of 2026

**Key tracking points:** Non-concurrence, conference committee process, both chambers adopting report
</details>

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

**Q: How often do Conference Committees happen?**  
A: Fairly common for significant bills. Maybe 10-20% of major bills that pass both chambers require conference committees. Minor bills often pass one chamber and die in the other.

**Q: What if Conference Committee negotiations fail?**  
A: The bill dies, or a new conference committee is appointed. Sometimes chambers just give up and move on to other priorities.

**Q: Can the Senate just force the House to pass a bill?**  
A: No. Each chamber is completely independent. The Senate cannot force House action, and vice versa. This is a key feature of bicameralism.

**Q: Why do chambers sometimes play games with each other's bills?**  
A: Politics, institutional pride, leverage for other negotiations. Each chamber protects its prerogatives and sometimes holds bills hostage to gain concessions on other issues.

**Q: As a Senate Bill Clerk, do I need to code House actions in detail?**  
A: You code when House messages are received and how Senate responds. You don't code the House's internal process (First Reading, committee, etc.) - just the outcome and Senate's reaction.
