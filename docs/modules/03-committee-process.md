## Why Committees Matter

Committees are where the real work of the Legislature happens. They:
- **Screen bills:** Most bills die in committee (60-70%)
- **Hold hearings:** Gather expert testimony and public input
- **Amend bills:** Make technical and policy changes
- **Conduct oversight:** Review state agencies and programs
- **Develop expertise:** Members specialize in policy areas

**For Bill Clerks:** You must accurately code which committee has a bill, what action the committee took, and when bills are reported back to the full Senate.

## Committee Roles and Structure

### Committee Chair
**Powers:**
- Sets committee agenda
- Decides which bills get hearings
- Chairs committee meetings
- Controls debate and recognition
- **Most important power:** Can kill bills by never scheduling hearings
- Typically from majority party

**Influence:** The chair controls the committee. If chair opposes a bill, it rarely moves forward.

### Committee Vice Chair(s)
- Assists chair
- Presides when chair is absent
- May have special responsibilities (e.g., budget subcommittees)
- Usually from majority party, but sometimes one vice chair from minority party

### Committee Members
- Attend hearings and meetings
- Question witnesses
- Offer amendments
- Vote on bills
- Typically 5-15 members per committee
- Party ratio usually reflects Senate overall (e.g., if Senate is 20-18, committee might be 5-4)

### Committee Staff
- **Not senators:** Professional staff hired by committee
- Research issues
- Draft amendments
- Brief senators
- Manage logistics of hearings

**Bill Clerk Note:** You don't code staff actions, only senator actions.

---

## Committee Procedures

### How Committee Meetings Work

#### 1. **Scheduling**
- Chair decides when to meet
- Meetings publicly noticed (usually 5 days advance)
- Held in Capitol or other state buildings

#### 2. **Public Hearings**
- Allow citizens, experts, lobbyists to testify
- Witnesses register in advance or day-of
- Typical order: Bill sponsor, proponents, opponents, neutral parties, public comment
- Committee members ask questions

#### 3. **Committee Discussion**
- Senators debate bill among themselves
- May request testimony from state agencies
- Staff provide analysis

#### 4. **Amendments**
- Committee members offer amendments
- Committee votes on amendments
- Amendments can make small or large changes

#### 5. **Committee Vote**
- Chair calls for vote on bill
- Voice vote or roll call
- Majority of committee members present must vote yes to report bill

#### 6. **Committee Report**
- If bill passes committee, it's "reported" back to full Senate
- Report includes committee recommendation (see next section)

---

## Committee Actions Bill Clerks Must Code

When a committee acts on a bill, Bill Clerks must accurately code the action. Here are the possible outcomes:

### 1. **Reported with Recommendation "Do Pass"**
**What it means:** Committee approves bill as written, no changes

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Committee reports SB X with recommendation 'do pass'"

**What happens next:** Bill goes to General Orders (Committee of the Whole)

**Example:**
"The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reports Senate Bill 145 with the recommendation 'do pass.'"

---

### 2. **Reported with Recommendation "Do Pass as Amended"**
**What it means:** Committee made changes (amendments) and approves amended version

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Committee reports SB X with recommendation 'do pass as amended'"

**What happens next:** Bill goes to General Orders with committee amendments

**Example:**
"The Committee on Health Policy reports Senate Bill 212 with the recommendation 'do pass as amended.'"

**Note:** The amendments become part of the bill unless General Orders rejects them.

---

### 3. **Reported with Committee Substitute (CS)**
**What it means:** Committee rewrote significant portions; original bill replaced with substitute

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Committee reports SB X with substitute (committee substitute)"

**What happens next:** Substitute goes to General Orders (original version is gone)

**Example:**
"The Committee on Education reports Senate Bill 78 with a committee substitute."

**Note:** Substitutes are major rewrites. Original sponsor may not even recognize the bill.

---

### 4. **Referred to Another Committee**
**What it means:** Committee sends bill to different committee for review

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Committee refers SB X to [Committee Name]"

**What happens next:** Bill goes to the other committee (starts committee process over)

**Common scenarios:**
- Policy committee → Appropriations (bill has fiscal impact)
- One policy committee → Different policy committee (jurisdictional issues)
- Substantive committee → Oversight (investigation needed)

**Example:**
"The Committee on Natural Resources and Agriculture reports Senate Bill 198 and refers the bill to the Committee on Appropriations."

**Note:** This is NOT a negative action. The first committee may have approved it but recognized fiscal impact.

---

### 5. **Postponed**
**What it means:** Committee delays decision, may reconsider later

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Committee postponed SB X"

**What happens next:** Bill stays in committee, may come back up for vote (or may never be seen again)

**Reasons for postponement:**
- Need more information
- Waiting for fiscal analysis
- Political timing issues
- Sponsor requested delay to work on amendments
- Close vote, chair wants to delay until more members present

**Example:**
"The Committee on Labor postponed consideration of Senate Bill 334."

---

### 6. **No Action / No Report**
**What it means:** Committee never votes on bill, or votes it down

**Bill Clerk Code:** Usually nothing to code (absence of action)

**What happens next:** Bill dies in committee

**Most common outcome:** Chair never schedules hearing, or committee votes "no" on reporting bill

**Note:** If committee votes down a bill, you might hear "motion to report failed" but often there's just silence - bill never emerges from committee.

---

### 7. **Discharged from Committee** (Rare)
**What it means:** Full Senate votes to take bill away from committee

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Senate discharged [Committee] from further consideration of SB X"

**What happens next:** Bill goes to floor without committee recommendation

**How it happens:**
- Requires motion and majority vote on Senate floor
- Used when committee chair is blocking popular bill
- Rare because it's seen as insulting to committee and chair
- Usually requires bipartisan support

**Example:**
"Senator Martinez moved to discharge the Committee on Elections and Ethics from further consideration of Senate Bill 56. Motion carried, Yeas 22, Nays 16."

---

## Special Committee Situations

### Multiple Referrals (Sequential)
**What it is:** Bill goes to one committee, then another, in sequence

**Common pattern:** Policy committee → Appropriations

**Example:**
"The Committee on Health Policy reports Senate Bill 401 with the recommendation 'do pass as amended' and refers the bill to the Committee on Appropriations."

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code both the committee recommendation AND the referral to next committee

**Why it happens:** Bill has both policy implications (first committee) and fiscal impact (Appropriations)

---

### Subcommittees
**What they are:** Smaller groups within a committee that focus on specific areas

**Most common in:** Appropriations Committee
- Appropriations has subcommittees for: Education, Health, Transportation, etc.
- Each subcommittee handles budget bills for its area

**Process:**
1. Bill referred to full Appropriations Committee
2. Chair assigns to subcommittee
3. Subcommittee holds hearing and votes
4. Subcommittee reports to full committee
5. Full committee votes
6. Full committee reports to Senate floor

**Bill Clerk Action:** Code subcommittee reports separately from full committee reports

**Example:**
"The Appropriations Subcommittee on Education reports Senate Bill 501 to the full Appropriations Committee with recommendation 'do pass.'"

---

### Joint Committee Hearings
**What they are:** Senate and House committees meet together to hear testimony

**Why:** Save time when both chambers considering similar bills

**Bill Clerk Note:** Each chamber's committee still votes separately and reports separately

---

### Committee of the Whole (Not a Standing Committee!)
**What it is:** The entire Senate acting as one committee (General Orders stage)

**Not a standing committee:** It's a procedural stage (covered in Module 4)

**Difference:**
- Standing committees: 5-15 senators, closed process
- Committee of the Whole: All 38 senators, floor debate

---

## The Appropriations Committee: A Special Case

The Appropriations Committee deserves extra attention because it's unique:

### Why Appropriations is Different:

1. **All spending bills go here eventually**
   - Even if bill starts in another committee
   - Appropriations has "last look" at fiscal impact

2. **Largest committee**
   - More members than other committees
   - Divided into subcommittees

3. **Budget bills originate here**
   - State budget starts in Appropriations
   - Education budget, department budgets, etc.

4. **More staff support**
   - Fiscal analysts
   - Budget experts

5. **Special power**
   - Can effectively kill bills by declaring them "too expensive"
   - Can demand offsets (spending cuts elsewhere to pay for new spending)

### Appropriations Process:

```
Bill involves spending money
         |
         v
Policy Committee reviews policy aspects
         |
         v
Policy Committee reports: "do pass, refer to Appropriations"
         |
         v
Appropriations Committee reviews fiscal impact
         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
    v         v
 Reports    Reports
"do pass"  "do pass as amended"
            (reduces spending)
    |         |
    +----+----+
         |
         v
Bill goes to General Orders and Third Reading
```

### Fiscal Notes
- All bills with spending get a "fiscal note" (cost estimate)
- Prepared by nonpartisan analysts
- Appropriations Committee reviews fiscal notes
- Committee may amend bill to reduce costs

**Bill Clerk Note:** When you see a bill referred to Appropriations, you know it spends money.

---

## Public Involvement in Committee Hearings

### Who Can Testify:
- Bill sponsors (always go first)
- Citizens
- Interest groups and lobbyists
- Experts (academics, researchers)
- State agency officials
- Local government representatives

### How Public Hearings Work:
1. Committee chair opens hearing
2. Bill sponsor presents bill
3. Proponents testify
4. Opponents testify
5. Neutral parties testify
6. Public comment (if time allows)
7. Committee members ask questions
8. Chair closes hearing

### Important for Bill Clerks:
- You don't code public testimony
- You only code committee actions (votes, reports, referrals)
- Hearings can last hours, but the vote takes seconds

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> Which committee handles all bills with fiscal impact?</summary>

**Answer:** The Appropriations Committee. Bills with spending often go to a policy committee first, then are referred to Appropriations for fiscal review.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the difference between "reported with recommendation do pass" and "reported with recommendation do pass as amended"?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- **"Do pass"** means the committee approves the bill as written with no changes
- **"Do pass as amended"** means the committee made amendments (changes) and approves the amended version
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 4:</strong> Who has the most power in a committee and why?</summary>

**Answer:** The committee chair has the most power because the chair decides which bills get hearings. If the chair doesn't schedule a hearing, the bill dies in committee. The chair also sets the agenda, controls debate, and manages committee operations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 5:</strong> A bill about K-12 teacher certification is referred to committee. Which committee would it likely go to?</summary>

**Answer:** The Education Committee (deals with K-12 policy, including teacher certification, curriculum, and school operations).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 6:</strong> What does it mean when a committee "refers a bill to another committee"?</summary>

**Answer:** The bill is sent to a different committee for additional review. This is common when a bill has both policy implications and fiscal impact (policy committee → Appropriations), or when jurisdiction is unclear. The bill starts the committee process over in the new committee.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 7:</strong> What is a committee substitute?</summary>

**Answer:** A committee substitute is when the committee significantly rewrites a bill. The original bill is replaced with the substitute version, which may be substantially different from what the sponsor introduced.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 8:</strong> True or False: If a committee postpones a bill, the bill automatically dies.</summary>

**Answer:** False. Postponement means the committee delays its decision. The bill may come back up for a vote later (though it often doesn't). The bill only dies if the committee never acts on it or votes it down.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 9:</strong> What is a discharge motion and when is it used?</summary>

**Answer:** A discharge motion is when the full Senate votes to remove a bill from committee and bring it to the floor. It's used (rarely) when a committee chair is blocking a bill that has broader support. Requires a majority vote on the Senate floor and is considered an extraordinary measure.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 10:</strong> A committee reports a bill "do pass" and refers it to Appropriations. What should a Bill Clerk code?</summary>

**Answer:** Code both actions: (1) The committee recommendation "do pass" and (2) the referral to the Appropriations Committee. The bill now goes to Appropriations, not to General Orders.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 11:</strong> What committee would handle a bill about: (a) Medicaid expansion, (b) minimum wage increase, (c) hunting regulations?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- (a) **Health Policy** (Medicaid policy) - then likely Appropriations (fiscal impact)
- (b) **Labor** (employment law, wages)
- (c) **Natural Resources and Agriculture** (wildlife, hunting/fishing regulations)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 12:</strong> What is the most common way bills die?</summary>

**Answer:** Dying in committee through inaction. The committee chair never schedules a hearing, or the committee votes not to report the bill. Approximately 60-70% of bills die in committee.
</details>

Next stage: Bill stays in committee; may be reconsidered later (or may die)
</details>

---

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

**Q: How do I know which committee a bill should go to if the subject overlaps multiple committees?**  
A: Leadership (President of Senate and Majority Leader) makes the final decision. Some bills could go to multiple committees. Listen for the referral announcement. Don't guess - wait for the official referral.

**Q: Can a bill skip committee?**  
A: Extremely rare. Theoretically possible with a discharge motion, but virtually all bills go through committee. The committee process is considered essential.

**Q: What if I miss which committee a bill was referred to?**  
A: Check the Senate Journal (official record) or ask your supervisor. Never guess on committee referrals.

**Q: Do I need to know every committee member's name?**  
A: Not initially, but you'll learn the committee chairs quickly. Focus on knowing the 17 committees and their jurisdictions first.

**Q: What if a committee reports a bill and I'm not sure if it's "do pass" or "do pass as amended"?**  
A: Listen carefully for "as amended." If you're unsure, flag it and ask your supervisor. Accuracy is critical.
