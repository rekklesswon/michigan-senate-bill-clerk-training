## Michigan's Bicameral Legislature

Michigan's Legislature consists of two chambers, making it **bicameral**:

### Michigan Senate
- **38 Senators** representing districts across Michigan
- **4-year terms** (half elected every 2 years)
- **Term limits:** Maximum of 2 full terms (8 years total in combined legislative service under new rules)
- **Districts:** Each senator represents approximately 260,000 constituents

### Michigan House of Representatives
- **110 Representatives** representing smaller districts
- **2-year terms** (all seats up for election every 2 years)
- **Term limits:** Same combined 8-year limit across both chambers
- **Districts:** Each representative represents approximately 90,000 constituents

### Why Bicameral?
- **Checks and balances:** Each chamber reviews the other's work
- **Different perspectives:** Senators have longer terms (more stability), Representatives are more frequently accountable to voters
- **Thorough review:** Bills must pass both chambers in identical form
- **Historical tradition:** Modeled after U.S. Congress

## The 17 Michigan Senate Standing Committees (2025-2026)

## The Senate's Role in Lawmaking

The Michigan Senate shares lawmaking responsibility with the House. Here's what the Senate does:

### Primary Functions:
1. **Introduce legislation:** Senators sponsor bills (designated with "SB" numbers)
2. **Review House bills:** All House bills (HB) must pass Senate to become law
3. **Committee review:** Committees hold hearings, amend, and vote on bills
4. **Floor debate:** Full Senate debates and amends bills
5. **Vote on passage:** Requires 20 votes (majority) to pass; 26 votes (2/3) for immediate effect
6. **Confirm appointments:** Senate confirms certain gubernatorial appointments
7. **Budget approval:** Must approve state budget (Appropriations Committee leads)

### Senate Advantages:
- **Longer terms:** 4 years allows more stability and less campaigning
- **Smaller size:** 38 members can build deeper relationships, easier to reach consensus
- **Greater prestige:** Often seen as "upper chamber"
- **Confirms appointments:** House does not have this power

### What Senate Does NOT Do:
- **Cannot pass laws alone:** House must also pass identical bill
- **Cannot override Governor alone:** Needs House for 2/3 override vote
- **Cannot tax without House:** Revenue bills can start in either chamber, but both must agree

## Federal vs. State Differences

While Michigan's system mirrors the federal government in many ways, there are important differences:

### Similarities:
- Three branches with separation of powers
- Bicameral legislature
- Governor signs/vetoes like President
- Override veto with 2/3 vote
- Committees review legislation
- Both chambers must pass identical bills

### Key Differences:

| Feature | U.S. Congress | Michigan Legislature |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Size** | 100 Senators, 435 Representatives | 38 Senators, 110 Representatives |
| **Senate Terms** | 6 years | 4 years |
| **House Terms** | 2 years | 2 years |
| **Senate President** | Vice President (rarely present) | Lt. Governor (regularly presides) |
| **Term Limits** | None | 8 years combined in Legislature |
| **Session Length** | Year-round | Year-round, but more breaks |
| **Immediate Effect** | Not applicable (federal laws have set effective dates) | Requires 2/3 vote; otherwise 90 days after session ends |
| **Subject Matter** | National/international issues, interstate commerce | State issues only (education, roads, state taxes, etc.) |
| **Impeachment** | House impeaches, Senate tries | House impeaches, Senate tries (same) |
| **Filibuster** | Senate allows unlimited debate | Michigan Senate does NOT have filibuster |
| **Cloture** | 60 votes to end debate (Senate) | Not applicable in Michigan |

### State Sovereignty
- Michigan can only legislate on **state matters**
- Cannot contradict federal law (Supremacy Clause)
- Cannot regulate interstate commerce (federal power)
- Examples of state powers: education, intrastate roads, state criminal law, professional licensing

## Why This Matters for Bill Clerks

As a Bill Clerk, you'll be tracking bills through this complex system in real-time. You need to know:

- **Which committee** a bill is in (affects timeline and amendments)
- **Leadership positions** (who controls the agenda)
- **Vote requirements** (20 for passage, 26 for immediate effect)
- **How Senate interacts with House** (bills must pass both)
- **Structure of government** (provides context for legislation)

Your job is to **accurately code** what happens to each bill as the Senate acts on it. Understanding the foundation helps you anticipate what comes next and catch errors.

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

Common questions from trainees:

**Q: Do I need to memorize all 17 committee names?**  
A: Yes, eventually. Start with the "big ones": Appropriations, Judiciary, Education, Health Policy, Transportation. You'll learn the others through repetition.

**Q: What if the Lt. Governor and Majority Leader are from different parties?**  
A: This is rare but possible. The Lt. Governor presides but the Majority Leader still controls the agenda. The presiding officer has limited power compared to the Majority Leader.

**Q: How do I know which committee a bill goes to?**  
A: The bill's subject matter determines this. You'll learn to recognize patterns. When in doubt, listen for the announcement or check the Senate Journal. The leadership makes the final decision.

**Q: What's the difference between "standing committees" and other committees?**  
A: Standing committees are permanent and meet regularly. Michigan also has special committees (temporary, for specific purposes) and conference committees (to reconcile House-Senate differences). You'll mostly deal with standing committees.
