- **Identify motions** and track their outcomes
- **Record votes** accurately (counts and results)
- **Code amendments** (who offered, result)
- **Track bill progress** through floor stages
- **Work quickly** - floor moves fast during busy sessions

## Order of Business: How a Senate Session Works

Michigan Senate sessions follow a standard order of business:

### 1. **Call to Order**
- President of Senate (Lt. Governor) or President Pro Tem gavels session to start
- Time noted (e.g., "Senate called to order at 10:00 a.m.")

### 2. **Invocation and Pledge**
- Opening prayer (rotating religious leaders)
- Pledge of Allegiance

### 3. **Roll Call**
- Secretary calls roll to establish quorum
- Quorum = majority of members (20 of 38)
- Without quorum, Senate cannot conduct business

### 4. **Messages from the Governor**
- Communications from Governor (veto messages, appointments, etc.)

### 5. **Messages from the House**
- Bills passed by House and sent to Senate
- House amendments to Senate bills
- Conference reports

### 6. **Introduction and First Reading of Bills**

- Not related to pending legislation

### 8. **Committee Reports**
- Committees report bills back to Senate
- Bills placed on General Orders or Third Reading

### 9. **General Orders (Committee of the Whole)**
- Debate and amendment of bills
- Less formal than Third Reading
- **Most floor action happens here**

### 10. **Third Reading of Bills**

## General Orders (Committee of the Whole)

### What is General Orders?

**General Orders** is when the entire Senate (38 members) acts as one large committee to debate and amend bills. It's also called "Committee of the Whole" or "Second Reading."

### Why "Committee of the Whole"?

Historically, legislative bodies would reconstitute themselves as a committee to allow more informal debate. The entire membership becomes a committee.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Less formal** than Third Reading
- **Amendments allowed** freely (don't need special permission)
- **Voice votes common** for amendments (vs. roll calls)
- **Debate is more flexible**
- **President may yield gavel** to President Pro Tem
- **Senate rules relaxed** slightly

### Purpose of General Orders:

1. **Amendment stage:** This is where most amendments are offered and debated
2. **Work out details:** Senators perfect the language
3. **Build consensus:** Negotiate changes to gain support
4. **Second look:** Full Senate reviews committee's work

### What Happens on General Orders:

```
Bill reported from committee
         |
         v
Placed on General Orders calendar
         |
         v
Bill sponsor explains bill
         |
         v

    (Voice votes or roll calls)
         |
         v

         |
    +----+----+
    |         |
    v         v

(20 votes) (Bill stays
           on GO or dies)
    |
    v

(Five-day rule starts)
```

### Bill Clerk Actions on General Orders:

**Listen for:**
- Bill number and sponsor
- Amendments offered (floor amendment numbers: FA 1, FA 2, etc.)
- Vote results on amendments (adopted/defeated)
- Motion to advance to Third Reading
- Vote on motion to advance

**Code:**
- Each amendment offered
- Result of each amendment vote
- Final action (advanced to Third Reading or not)

**Example:**
"Senate Bill 342 is before the Senate on General Orders. Senator Davis explains the bill. Senator Thompson offers Floor Amendment 1 to Senate Bill 342. Voice vote: Amendment adopted. Senator Lee offers Floor Amendment 2. Roll call: Yeas 18, Nays 20. Amendment defeated. Senator Davis moves the bill be advanced to Third Reading. Voice vote: Motion carried. Bill advanced to Third Reading."

## Floor Amendments

### Types of Amendments:

#### 1. **Committee Amendments**
- Already part of bill from committee
- Senate can adopt or reject committee amendments on General Orders
- Usually adopted without much debate (committee already reviewed)

#### 2. **Floor Amendments**
- Offered by individual Senators during General Orders
- Numbered sequentially: FA 1, FA 2, FA 3, etc.
- Can be simple (technical fixes) or substantive (major policy changes)

#### 3. **Substitute Amendments**
- Replace entire bill with new language
- Rare on floor (more common in committee)

#### 4. **Amendments to Amendments**
- Amending an amendment before voting on it
- Can get complex quickly

### Amendment Process:

1. **Senator offers amendment:** "I offer Floor Amendment 1 to Senate Bill X"
2. **Amendment is read or explained**
3. **Debate** on amendment (if any)
4. **Vote on amendment:** Voice vote or roll call
5. **Result announced:** "Amendment adopted" or "Amendment defeated"
6. **Repeat** for each amendment

### Amendment Numbering:

- Floor amendments numbered in order offered: FA 1, FA 2, FA 3...
- Numbering is **per bill** (SB 100 FA 1, SB 101 FA 1, etc.)
- **Committee amendments** may have different designations

### Friendly vs. Hostile Amendments:

- **Friendly:** Bill sponsor supports amendment
- **Hostile:** Bill sponsor opposes amendment
- Both are voted on the same way

**Bill Clerk Note:** You code all amendments and results, regardless of whether they're friendly or hostile.

### Amendment Adoption:

- **Voice vote** most common on General Orders
- **Roll call vote** if requested by any Senator
- **Majority required** to adopt amendment (20 of 38 if all present)

---

## Voting Procedures

### Three Types of Votes:

#### 1. **Voice Vote** 🗣️

**How it works:**
- President: "All in favor say 'aye.' All opposed say 'no.'"
- Senators respond verbally
- President determines outcome based on volume
- **No individual record** of who voted how

**When used:**
- Most amendments on General Orders
- Non-controversial motions
- Procedural matters
- Resolutions

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Voice vote: Motion carried" or "Voice vote: Motion failed"

**Note:** Voice votes are quick but don't provide individual accountability.

---

#### 2. **Roll Call Vote** 📊

**How it works:**
- Secretary calls each Senator's name alphabetically
- Each Senator responds: "Yes," "No," or "Pass"
- Senators who "pass" can vote when roll call comes back around
- Votes recorded individually and publicly
- Final tally announced

**When required:**
- **Third Reading passage votes** (always roll call)
- **Immediate effect votes** (always roll call)
- **Veto overrides** (always roll call)
- **Conference reports** (usually roll call)

**When requested:**
- Any Senator can request roll call on any question
- Typical request: "I request a roll call vote"

**Bill Clerk Code:** Record each Senator's vote and final tally
- Example: "Roll call: Yeas 28, Nays 10, Excused 0, Not Voting 0"

**Excused vs. Not Voting:**
- **Excused:** Absent with permission (illness, other official duty)
- **Not Voting:** Present but chose not to vote (rare; sometimes conflict of interest)

---

#### 3. **Division Vote** (Rare) ✋

**How it works:**
- After unclear voice vote, President orders division
- Senators in favor stand and are counted
- Senators opposed stand and are counted
- No individual record (just counts)

**When used:**
- Voice vote outcome unclear
- Rarely used in modern practice (roll call more common)

**Bill Clerk Code:** "Division vote: Yeas 22, Nays 16, Motion carried"

---

### Vote Requirements Summary:

| Action | Votes Needed | Type of Vote |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Adopt amendment (GO) | Majority present | Voice or roll call |
| Advance to Third Reading | Majority present (20 if all present) | Voice or roll call |
| Pass bill (Third Reading) | **20 (majority of 38)** | **Roll call required** |
| Immediate effect | **26 (2/3 of 38)** | **Roll call required** |
| Concur in amendments | 20 | Roll call usually |
| Conference report | 20 | Roll call usually |
| Override veto | 26 (2/3) | Roll call required |
| Procedural motions | Majority present | Usually voice |

---

## Third Reading and Final Passage

### What is Third Reading?

Third Reading is the **final, formal vote** on a bill. It's the point of no return.

### Characteristics:

- **Very formal** (stricter rules than General Orders)
- **No amendments** without special consent (unanimous or 2/3 vote)
- **Bill read by title** (third time)
- **Roll call vote required** for passage
- **Public record** of each Senator's position

### Five-Day Rule Reminder:

Before Third Reading vote, bill must have been in its final form and available for **5 calendar days**.

### Third Reading Process:

1. **President announces:** "Third Reading of Senate Bill X"
2. **Bill read by title** (or full reading if requested)
3. **Limited debate** (less flexible than General Orders)
4. **President calls the question:** "The question being on passage of the bill"
5. **Roll call vote taken**
6. **Result announced:** "The bill passed" or "The bill failed"
7. **If passed, immediate effect vote** (if applicable)

### Bill Clerk Actions:

**Listen for:**
- Bill number
- Vote count (Yeas, Nays, Excused, Not Voting)
- Result (passed/failed)
- Immediate effect vote (if applicable)

**Code:**
- Third Reading action
- Vote totals
- Bill passed or failed
- Immediate effect result (if applicable)

**Example:**
"Third Reading of Senate Bill 567. The question being on passage of the bill. The Secretary will call the roll. [Roll call occurs] The bill passed. Yeas 32, Nays 6, Excused 0, Not Voting 0."

---

## Immediate Effect Votes ⚡

### What is Immediate Effect?

Michigan laws normally take effect **90 days after the Legislature adjourns** for the year. Immediate effect allows a law to take effect **immediately upon the Governor's signature**.

### Why It Matters:

- **Urgent laws:** Emergency measures, time-sensitive issues
- **Budget bills:** Need to take effect in fiscal year
- **Most bills:** Include immediate effect clause to avoid 90-day delay

### Voting Requirement:

**26 votes (2/3 of 38 Senators) required**

### Process:

1. Bill passes Third Reading (20+ votes)
2. Sponsor or leader moves immediate effect: "I move immediate effect"
3. Roll call vote on immediate effect
4. Result announced

### Possible Outcomes:

| Yeas | Result |
|------|--------|
| 26+ | **Immediate effect granted** - Law takes effect upon Governor's signature |
| 25 or fewer | **Immediate effect denied** - Law takes effect 90 days after session ends |

**Important:** Bill still becomes law even if immediate effect fails. It just takes effect later.

### Bill Clerk Actions:

**Listen for:**
- Motion for immediate effect
- Vote count on immediate effect
- Result (granted or denied)

**Code:**
- Immediate effect vote separately from passage vote
- Record Yeas, Nays, Excused, Not Voting
- Note result (granted/denied)

**Example:**
"Senator Martinez moves immediate effect. The question being on immediate effect. The Secretary will call the roll. [Roll call] Immediate effect is granted. Yeas 27, Nays 11."

**Common Scenario:** Bill passes 32-6, but immediate effect passes 25-13. Immediate effect **denied** (needs 26). Law still becomes law but takes effect in 90 days.

## Self-Check Quiz

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 1:</strong> What is General Orders (Committee of the Whole) and what happens there?</summary>

**Answer:** General Orders is when the entire Senate (38 members) acts as one committee to debate and amend bills. It's less formal than Third Reading, and this is the primary stage where amendments are offered and debated. After General Orders, bills are advanced to Third Reading for final passage.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> What are the three types of votes used in the Senate?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **Voice vote** - Senators say "aye" or "no," no individual record
2. **Roll call vote** - Each Senator's vote recorded individually, required for passage and immediate effect
3. **Division vote** - Senators stand to be counted (rare in modern practice)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 3:</strong> A bill is on Third Reading. Can Senators offer amendments?</summary>

**Answer:** Generally no. Third Reading is for final passage vote only. Amendments require special consent (unanimous consent or 2/3 vote to suspend rules), which is rare. Amendments are debated during General Orders (Second Reading).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 4:</strong> A bill passes Third Reading with 28 votes. How many votes are needed for immediate effect? What happens if immediate effect gets only 24 votes?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- **26 votes** (2/3 of 38) needed for immediate effect
- If only 24 votes: **Immediate effect denied**, but the bill still becomes law - it just takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns instead of immediately upon the Governor's signature
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 5:</strong> What is the difference between "motion to table" and "motion to postpone"?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- **Motion to table:** Postpones indefinitely (usually kills the bill)
- **Motion to postpone:** Delays to specific time (bill will come back)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 6:</strong> During General Orders, Senator Smith offers Floor Amendment 1 to SB 200. Voice vote: Amendment adopted. Senator Jones offers Floor Amendment 2. Roll call: Yeas 15, Nays 23. What do you code?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- FA 1 to SB 200: Adopted (voice vote)
- FA 2 to SB 200: Defeated (Roll call: Yeas 15, Nays 23)
- Code both amendments with their results
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 7:</strong> What does "motion to reconsider" do?</summary>

**Answer:** Motion to reconsider brings back a vote that already happened, nullifying the previous vote so a new vote can be taken. It must usually be made the same day or next session day.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 8:</strong> The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's options?</summary>

**Answer:** 
1. **Concur** - Accept House amendments (requires 20 votes)
2. **Non-concur** - Reject House amendments (usually leads to conference committee)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 9:</strong> What is a quorum, and why does it matter?</summary>

**Answer:** A quorum is the minimum number of Senators who must be present for the Senate to conduct business. Quorum is 20 of 38 (majority). Without a quorum, the Senate cannot vote on bills or take official action.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 10:</strong> What is a point of order?</summary>

**Answer:** A point of order is when a Senator believes Senate rules are being violated. The Senator rises and states the point of order, and the President rules on whether the objection is valid. The President's ruling can be appealed to the full Senate.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 11:</strong> True or False: Voice votes provide a public record of how each Senator voted.</summary>

**Answer:** False. Voice votes do NOT provide individual voting records - only the overall outcome (carried or failed). Roll call votes provide individual voting records.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 12:</strong> What votes are always roll calls (not voice votes)?</summary>

**Answer:** 
- Third Reading passage votes
- Immediate effect votes
- Veto overrides
These always require recorded roll call votes.
</details>

## Practice Coding Exercise

**You're a Bill Clerk coding floor proceedings. Here's what you hear:**

"Senate Bill 445 is before the Senate on General Orders. Senator Williams explains the bill. Senator Jackson offers Floor Amendment 1 to Senate Bill 445. Voice vote. Amendment adopted. Senator Lee offers Floor Amendment 2. Debate ensues. Senator Davis requests a roll call. Roll call: Yeas 12, Nays 26, Excused 0, Not Voting 0. Floor Amendment 2 defeated. Senator Williams moves the bill be advanced to Third Reading. Voice vote. Motion carried."

**[Next session day, after 5 days pass]**

"Third Reading of Senate Bill 445. The question being on passage of the bill. The Secretary will call the roll. Roll call: Yeas 22, Nays 16, Excused 0, Not Voting 0. The bill passed. Senator Williams moves immediate effect. The question being on immediate effect. The Secretary will call the roll. Roll call: Yeas 28, Nays 10, Excused 0, Not Voting 0. Immediate effect is granted."

<details>
<summary><strong>What should you have coded?</strong></summary>

**General Orders Actions:**
- SB 445 on General Orders
- FA 1 offered by Sen. Jackson: Adopted (voice vote)
- FA 2 offered by Sen. Lee: Defeated (Roll call: 12-26)
- Motion to advance to Third Reading: Carried (voice vote)

**Third Reading Actions:**
- SB 445 Third Reading
- Passage vote: PASSED (Roll call: 22-16)
- Immediate effect vote: GRANTED (Roll call: 28-10)

**Next Step:** Bill sent to House
</details>

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

**Q: What if I miss an amendment number?**  
A: Ask for clarification immediately or check with your supervisor. Floor amendments are numbered sequentially per bill, so if you miss one, count back through the proceedings.

**Q: How fast does the floor move?**  
A: Varies wildly. Some days, dozens of bills pass quickly with no debate. Other days, one controversial bill takes hours. You must be ready for both.

**Q: What if I can't hear the vote count?**  
A: Flag it immediately. In modern chambers, vote counts are displayed electronically. Never guess - verify with official count.

**Q: Can voice votes be challenged?**  
A: Yes. Any Senator can request a roll call or division vote if they believe the voice vote result was wrong.

**Q: What's the difference between "Excused" and "Not Voting"?**
