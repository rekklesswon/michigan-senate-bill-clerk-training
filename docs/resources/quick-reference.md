## Immediate Effect Guide

**Why it matters:** Laws normally take effect 90 days after session ends. IE makes them effective immediately.

**Requirements:**
- Separate vote AFTER passage
- Needs 26 votes (2/3)
- Always roll call vote

**Possible outcomes:**
- **26+ votes:** IE granted → Law effective when Governor signs
- **25 or fewer:** IE denied → Law effective 90 days after sine die
- **Important:** Bill still becomes law even if IE denied!
