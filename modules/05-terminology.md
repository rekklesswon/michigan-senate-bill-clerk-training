## Core Legislative Terms

### Bill

## Self-Check Quiz

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> What does "SB 234" tell you?</summary>

**Answer:** SB = Senate Bill, meaning this bill originated in the Michigan Senate (not the House). The number 234 is the sequential number assigned when the bill was introduced.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the difference between "sponsor" and "co-sponsor"?</summary>

**Answer:** The **sponsor** is the Senator who introduces the bill and is its primary author/champion. **Co-sponsors** are other Senators who add their names in support but didn't introduce the bill.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 4:</strong> A bill is "referred to committee." What does that mean?</summary>

**Answer:** The bill has been assigned to a committee for review. The committee will decide whether to hold hearings, make amendments, and report the bill back to the full Senate.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 5:</strong> What is "General Orders"?</summary>

**Answer:** General Orders (also called Committee of the Whole or Second Reading) is the stage where the full Senate debates bills and considers amendments. It's less formal than Third Reading.
</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 9:</strong> What does "immediate effect denied" mean?</summary>

**Answer:** The bill did not receive enough votes (26 required) for immediate effect. The bill can still become law, but it will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends instead of immediately when the Governor signs it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 10:</strong> What is the difference between "tabled" and "postponed"?</summary>

## Notes for Instructor Q&A

**Q: What if I hear a term I don't recognize during a live session?**  
A: Flag it and ask your supervisor after the immediate action is coded. Don't let unfamiliar terms stop you from coding what you do understand.

**Q: Are there regional variations in terminology?**  
A: Some terms vary between states, but within Michigan, terminology is standardized. Always use Michigan's official terms.

**Q: How can I practice terminology?**
