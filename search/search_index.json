Approximately half are elected every 2 years.   Question 2: Who presides over the Michigan Senate, and when do they vote?  **Answer:** The Lieutenant Governor serves as President of the Senate. The Lt. Governor only votes to break tie votes.   Question 3: Which Senate leadership position has the most day-to-day power over the legislative agenda?  **Answer:** The Majority Leader controls the legislative agenda, determines which bills come up for votes, and Controls all committee referrals.   Question 4: Name at least 5 of the 17 Michigan Senate standing committees.  **Answer:** Any 5 of: Appropriations, Civil Rights/Judiciary/Public Safety, Economic and Community Development, Education, Elections and Ethics, Energy and Environment, Finance/Insurance/Consumer Protection, Government Operations, Health Policy, Housing and Human Services, Labor, Local Government, Natural Resources and Agriculture, Oversight, Regulatory Affairs, Transportation and Infrastructure, Veterans and Emergency Services.   Question 5: What committee has special status and reviews all bills with fiscal impact?  **Answer:** The Appropriations Committee reviews all bills with fiscal impact (that spend state money).   Question 6: How many votes are needed for a bill to pass the Senate?  **Answer:** 20 votes (a majority of the 38 members) are needed for passage. 26 votes (2/3 majority) are needed if the bill is to take immediate effect.   Question 7: True or False: The Michigan Senate has a filibuster like the U.S. Senate.  **Answer:** False. The Michigan Senate does not have unlimited debate/filibuster rules like the U.S. Senate.   Question 8: What happens if the Senate passes a bill but the House does not?  **Answer:** The bill does not become law. Both chambers must pass identical versions of a bill for it to be sent to the Governor.   Question 9: What are the three branches of Michigan government?  **Answer:** Executive (Governor), Legislative (Senate and House), and Judicial (Courts led by Supreme Court).   Question 10: A bill about K-12 school funding would likely be referred to which committee first, and then which committee second?  **Answer:** First to the Education Committee (subject matter), then to the Appropriations Committee (because it involves spending state money)."},{"location":"modules/01-foundations/#notes-for-instructor-qa","title":"Notes for Instructor Q&amp;A","text":"<p>Common questions from trainees:</p> <p>Q: Do I need to memorize all 17 committee names? A: Yes, eventually. Start with the \"big ones\": Appropriations, Judiciary, Education, Health Policy, Transportation. You'll learn the others through repetition.</p> <p>Q: What if the Lt. Governor and Majority Leader are from different parties? A: This is rare but possible. The Lt. Governor presides but the Majority Leader still controls the agenda. The presiding officer has limited power compared to the Majority Leader.</p> <p>Q: How do I know which committee a bill goes to? A: The bill's subject matter determines this. You'll learn to recognize patterns. When in doubt, listen for the announcement or check the Senate Journal. The leadership makes the final decision.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between \"standing committees\" and other committees? A: Standing committees are permanent and meet regularly. Michigan also has special committees (temporary, for specific purposes) and conference committees (to reconcile House-Senate differences).

Question 2: A bill is placed on the Third Reading calendar on Monday, March 3. What is the earliest date the Senate can vote on final passage?  **Answer:** Saturday, March 8 (five full calendar days later). The five-day rule requires 5 calendar days (not session days) to pass before final vote.   Question 3: How many votes are needed to pass a bill in the Senate? How many for immediate effect?  **Answer:**  - **20 votes** (majority of 38) needed for passage - **26 votes** (2/3 of 38) needed for immediate effect  Question 4: What happens during General Orders (Committee of the Whole)?  **Answer:** General Orders is the stage where the full Senate debates the bill and considers amendments. Senators can offer floor amendments, which are voted on. After debate and amendments, the Senate votes to advance the bill to Third Reading. This is a less formal stage than Third Reading.   Question 5: The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's options?  **Answer:**  1. **Concur** - Accept the House amendments (requires 20 votes); bill goes to Governor 2. **Non-concur** - Reject the House amendments; typically leads to requesting a Conference Committee to negotiate a compromise  Question 6: What are the three options the Governor has when a bill reaches their desk?  **Answer:**  1. **Sign** - Bill becomes a Public Act (law) 2. **Veto** - Reject the bill (Legislature can override with 2/3 vote) 3. **Do Nothing** - Bill becomes law after 14 days if Legislature is in session; dies if Legislature has adjourned (pocket veto)  Question 7: A bill passes the Senate and House with immediate effect. When does the law take effect if the Governor signs it?  **Answer:** Immediately upon the Governor's signature. The immediate effect clause allows laws to take effect right away instead of waiting 90 days after session ends.   Question 8: What is the most common way bills die in the Legislature?  **Answer:** Dying in committee (no action taken). The committee chair simply never schedules a hearing on the bill, or the committee votes it down. Approximately 60-70% of bills die in committee.   Question 9: True or False: If both chambers pass a bill but in different forms, the bill can still go to the Governor.  **Answer:** False. Both chambers must pass the bill in **identical form** before it goes to the Governor. If the versions differ, the chambers must resolve the differences (through concurrence or conference committee).   Question 10: What is a Conference Report and when is it used?  **Answer:** A Conference Report is a compromise version of a bill created by a Conference Committee (3 Senators + 3 Representatives) when the two chambers pass different versions and cannot reach agreement through concurrence. Both chambers must approve the Conference Report without amendments for the bill to proceed to the Governor.   Question 11: Without immediate effect, when do Michigan laws take effect?  **Answer:** 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the year (sine die adjournment). This is why most bills include immediate effect clauses.   Question 12: Can amendments be offered during Third Reading?  **Answer:** Generally no. Third Reading is for final passage vote only. Amendments are debated and adopted during General Orders (Second Reading). Amendments during Third Reading require special consent, which is rare."},{"location":"modules/02-bill-lifecycle/#practical-exercise-track-this-bill","title":"Practical Exercise: Track This Bill","text":"<p>Scenario: You're a Bill Clerk watching Senate proceedings.</p> <p>Senator Williams announces: \"Mr. President, I introduce Senate Bill 421, to amend the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act regarding wetlands conservation.\"</p> <p>President of Senate: \"Senate Bill 421, first reading.

A: The five-day rule is a minimum. Bills can sit on Third Reading for weeks or months if leadership doesn't schedule the vote.</p> <p>Q: Can the five-day rule be waived? A: Yes, but only by 2/3 vote of the Senate, and it's very rare. Usually reserved for true emergencies.</p> <p>Q: What happens if the Senate violates the five-day rule? A: The vote can be challenged and ruled invalid. The law could be struck down in court. It's a serious procedural error.</p> <p>Q: How do I know if a bill needs to go to Appropriations? A: Listen for fiscal impact statements. If a bill spends state money, it usually goes to Appropriations. Bills often go to policy committee first, then Appropriations.</p> <p>Q: What if the House makes dozens of amendments? A: The Senate can concur in all of them, non-concur and request conference, or (rarely) concur in some and not others (requires special procedures).</p> <p>Q: Do I need to memorize all these stages?

Appropriations 2. Civil Rights, Judiciary, and Public Safety 3. Economic and Community Development 4. Education 5. Elections and Ethics 6. Energy and Environment 7. Finance, Insurance, and Consumer Protection 8. Government Operations 9. Health Policy 10. Housing and Human Services 11. Labor 12. Local Government 13. Natural Resources and Agriculture 14. Oversight 15. Regulatory Affairs 16. Transportation and Infrastructure 17. Veterans and Emergency Services  Question 2: Which committee handles all bills with fiscal impact?  **Answer:** The Appropriations Committee. Bills with spending often go to a policy committee first, then are referred to Appropriations for fiscal review.  Question 3: What is the difference between \"reported with recommendation do pass\" and \"reported with recommendation do pass as amended\"?  **Answer:**  - **\"Do pass\"** means the committee approves the bill as written with no changes - **\"Do pass as amended\"** means the committee made amendments (changes) and approves the amended version  Question 4: Who has the most power in a committee and why?  **Answer:** The committee chair has the most power because the chair decides which bills get hearings. If the chair doesn't schedule a hearing, the bill dies in committee. The chair also sets the agenda, controls debate, and manages committee operations.  Question 5: A bill about K-12 teacher certification is referred to committee. Which committee would it likely go to?  **Answer:** The Education Committee (deals with K-12 policy, including teacher certification, curriculum, and school operations).  Question 6: What does it mean when a committee \"refers a bill to another committee\"?  **Answer:** The bill is sent to a different committee for additional review. This is common when a bill has both policy implications and fiscal impact (policy committee \u2192 Appropriations), or when jurisdiction is unclear. The bill starts the committee process over in the new committee.  Question 7: What is a committee substitute?  **Answer:** A committee substitute is when the committee significantly rewrites a bill. The original bill is replaced with the substitute version, which may be substantially different from what the sponsor introduced.  Question 8: True or False: If a committee postpones a bill, the bill automatically dies.  **Answer:** False. Postponement means the committee delays its decision. The bill may come back up for a vote later (though it often doesn't). The bill only dies if the committee never acts on it or votes it down.  Question 9: What is a discharge motion and when is it used?  **Answer:** A discharge motion is when the full Senate votes to remove a bill from committee and bring it to the floor. It's used (rarely) when a committee chair is blocking a bill that has broader support. Requires a majority vote on the Senate floor and is considered an extraordinary measure.  Question 10: A committee reports a bill \"do pass\" and refers it to Appropriations. What should a Bill Clerk code?  **Answer:** Code both actions: (1) The committee recommendation \"do pass\" and (2) the referral to the Appropriations Committee. The bill now goes to Appropriations, not to General Orders.  Question 11: What committee would handle a bill about: (a) Medicaid expansion, (b) minimum wage increase, (c) hunting regulations?  **Answer:**  - (a) **Health Policy** (Medicaid policy) - then likely Appropriations (fiscal impact) - (b) **Labor** (employment law, wages) - (c) **Natural Resources and Agriculture** (wildlife, hunting/fishing regulations)  Question 12: What is the most common way bills die?  **Answer:** Dying in committee through inaction. The committee chair never schedules a hearing, or the committee votes not to report the bill. Approximately 60-70% of bills die in committee."},{"location":"modules/03-committee-process/#practice-scenario-coding-committee-actions","title":"Practice Scenario: Coding Committee Actions","text":"<p>You're a Bill Clerk listening to committee reports.

It's less formal than Third Reading, and this is the primary stage where amendments are offered and debated. After General Orders, bills are advanced to Third Reading for final passage.  Question 2: What are the three types of votes used in the Senate?  **Answer:**  1. **Voice vote** - Senators say \"aye\" or \"no,\" no individual record 2. **Roll call vote** - Each Senator's vote recorded individually, required for passage and immediate effect 3. **Division vote** - Senators stand to be counted (rare in modern practice)  Question 3: A bill is on Third Reading. Can Senators offer amendments?  **Answer:** Generally no. Third Reading is for final passage vote only. Amendments require special consent (unanimous consent or 2/3 vote to suspend rules), which is rare. Amendments are debated during General Orders (Second Reading).  Question 4: A bill passes Third Reading with 28 votes. How many votes are needed for immediate effect? What happens if immediate effect gets only 24 votes?  **Answer:**  - **26 votes** (2/3 of 38) needed for immediate effect - If only 24 votes: **Immediate effect denied**, but the bill still becomes law - it just takes effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns instead of immediately upon the Governor's signature  Question 5: What is the difference between \"motion to table\" and \"motion to postpone\"?  **Answer:**  - **Motion to table:** Postpones indefinitely (usually kills the bill) - **Motion to postpone:** Delays to specific time (bill will come back)  Question 6: During General Orders, Senator Smith offers Floor Amendment 1 to SB 200. Voice vote: Amendment adopted. Senator Jones offers Floor Amendment 2. Roll call: Yeas 15, Nays 23. What do you code?  **Answer:**  - FA 1 to SB 200: Adopted (voice vote) - FA 2 to SB 200: Defeated (Roll call: Yeas 15, Nays 23) - Code both amendments with their results  Question 7: What does \"motion to reconsider\" do?  **Answer:** Motion to reconsider brings back a vote that already happened, nullifying the previous vote so a new vote can be taken. It must usually be made the same day or next session day.  Question 8: The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's options?  **Answer:**  1. **Concur** - Accept House amendments (requires 20 votes) 2. **Non-concur** - Reject House amendments (usually leads to conference committee)  Question 9: What is a quorum, and why does it matter?  **Answer:** A quorum is the minimum number of Senators who must be present for the Senate to conduct business. Quorum is 20 of 38 (majority). Without a quorum, the Senate cannot vote on bills or take official action.  Question 10: What is a point of order?  **Answer:** A point of order is when a Senator believes Senate rules are being violated. The Senator rises and states the point of order, and the President rules on whether the objection is valid. The President's ruling can be appealed to the full Senate.  Question 11: True or False: Voice votes provide a public record of how each Senator voted.  **Answer:** False. Voice votes do NOT provide individual voting records - only the overall outcome (carried or failed). Roll call votes provide individual voting records.  Question 12: What votes are always roll calls (not voice votes)?  **Answer:**  - Third Reading passage votes - Immediate effect votes - Veto overrides These always require recorded roll call votes."},{"location":"modules/04-floor-procedures/#practice-coding-exercise","title":"Practice Coding Exercise","text":"<p>You're a Bill Clerk coding floor proceedings.

A: Flag it immediately. In modern chambers, vote counts are displayed electronically. Never guess - verify with official count.</p> <p>Q: Can voice votes be challenged? A: Yes. Any Senator can request a roll call or division vote if they believe the voice vote result was wrong.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between \"Excused\" and \"Not Voting\"? A: Excused = Absent with permission (illness, official duty). Not Voting = Present but chose not to vote (rare, sometimes due to conflict of interest).</p>"},{"location":"modules/04-floor-procedures/#key-takeaways","title":"Key Takeaways","text":"<p>\u2705 General Orders is the debate and amendment stage (less formal) \u2705 Third Reading is the final passage vote (very formal) \u2705 20 votes for passage, 26 votes for immediate effect \u2705 Roll call votes required for passage and immediate effect \u2705 Voice votes common for amendments and procedural motions \u2705 Bill Clerks must listen carefully and code actions in real-time \u2705 Know common motions: advance, table, postpone, refer, reconsider, concur \u2705 Five-day rule applies between Third Reading placement and final vote  </p>"},{"location":"modules/04-floor-procedures/#navigation_1","title":"Navigation","text":"<p>Previous: Module 3: Committee Process Next: Module 5: Terminology Back to: Course Home</p> <p>Last Updated: January 2026 for 2025-2026 Legislative Session</p>"},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/","title":"Module 5: Legislative Terminology and Language","text":"<p>Progress</p> <p>Module 5 of 6 \u2022 2-3 hours</p> <p>Estimated Time: 2-3 hours</p>"},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>By the end of this module, you will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Define core legislative terms used in Michigan Senate</li> <li>Recognize bill status terminology</li> <li>Understand committee and floor action terms</li> <li>Identify voting terminology</li> <li>Use common legislative abbreviations correctly</li> <li>Interpret phrases you'll hear during Senate sessions</li> <li>Apply terminology in practice scenarios</li> </ul>"},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/#navigation","title":"Navigation","text":"<p>Previous: Module 4: Floor Procedures Next: Module 6: House Interaction Back to: Course Home</p>"},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/#why-terminology-matters","title":"Why Terminology Matters","text":"<p>Legislative proceedings use precise, sometimes archaic language.

A **Public Act (PA)** is a bill that has passed both chambers and been signed into law by the Governor. Bills are proposals; Public Acts are actual laws.   Question 2: What does \"SB 234\" tell you?  **Answer:** SB = Senate Bill, meaning this bill originated in the Michigan Senate (not the House). The number 234 is the sequential number assigned when the bill was introduced.   Question 3: What is the difference between \"sponsor\" and \"co-sponsor\"?  **Answer:** The **sponsor** is the Senator who introduces the bill and is its primary author/champion. **Co-sponsors** are other Senators who add their names in support but didn't introduce the bill.   Question 4: A bill is \"referred to committee.\" What does that mean?  **Answer:** The bill has been assigned to a committee for review. The committee will decide whether to hold hearings, make amendments, and report the bill back to the full Senate.   Question 5: What is \"General Orders\"?  **Answer:** General Orders (also called Committee of the Whole or Second Reading) is the stage where the full Senate debates bills and considers amendments. It's less formal than Third Reading.   Question 6: What does it mean when a bill is \"enrolled\"?  **Answer:** The bill has passed both the Senate and House in identical form and is being officially prepared to send to the Governor for signature.   Question 7: What's the difference between \"Yeas\" and \"Nays\"?  **Answer:** **Yeas** (or Ayes) are \"yes\" votes. **Nays** (or Noes) are \"no\" votes.   Question 8: What is a quorum and why does it matter?  **Answer:** A **quorum** is the minimum number of Senators required to conduct business (20 of 38 in Michigan Senate). Without a quorum present, the Senate cannot vote on bills or take official actions.   Question 9: What does \"immediate effect denied\" mean?  **Answer:** The bill did not receive enough votes (26 required) for immediate effect. The bill can still become law, but it will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends instead of immediately when the Governor signs it.   Question 10: What is the difference between \"tabled\" and \"postponed\"?  **Answer:** **Tabled** means postponed indefinitely (usually kills the bill - it rarely comes back). **Postponed** means delayed to a specific time (the bill will be reconsidered).   Question 11: What does \"sine die\" mean?  **Answer:** **Sine die** (Latin: \"without day\") means final adjournment of the legislative session for the year. Bills that haven't passed by sine die must be reintroduced in the next session.   Question 12: The Senate \"concurs\" in House amendments. What happens next?  **Answer:** The bill has passed both chambers in identical form and is sent to the Governor for signature."},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/#glossary-quick-reference","title":"Glossary Quick Reference","text":"<p>For quick lookup during training or interviews:</p> Term Short Definition Bill Proposed law PA Public Act (enacted law) SB Senate Bill HB House Bill Sponsor Senator who introduces bill Referred Assigned to committee Reported Committee sends bill back to Senate GO General Orders (amendment stage) 3rd Reading Final passage vote Passed Bill got 20+ votes IE Immediate effect (needs 26 votes) Yeas Yes votes Nays No votes Roll Call Individual votes recorded Voice Vote No individual record Quorum 20 Senators (minimum to conduct business) Concur Accept other chamber's amendments Non-Concur Reject other chamber's amendments Enrolled Passed both chambers, sent to Governor Sine Die Final adjournment of session"},{"location":"modules/05-terminology/#notes-for-instructor-qa","title":"Notes for Instructor Q&amp;A","text":"<p>Q: Do I need to memorize all these terms? A: Core terms (bill, SB, PA, passed, referred, GO, Third Reading, IE, concur) are essential. Others you'll learn through repetition. Focus on terms you'll hear most often during sessions.</p> <p>Q: What if I hear a term I don't recognize during a live session? A: Flag it and ask your supervisor after the immediate action is coded. Don't let unfamiliar terms stop you from coding what you do understand.</p> <p>Q: Are there regional variations in terminology? A: Some terms vary between states, but within Michigan, terminology is standardized. Always use Michigan's official terms.</p> <p>Q: How can I practice terminology? A: Read the Senate Journal, watch archived sessions, and complete the practice scenarios in this course.

Michigan's bicameral system requires both the Senate (38 members) and House (110 members) to pass exactly the same version of a bill before it can be sent to the Governor. This ensures thorough review and broader consensus.  Question 2: The House passes a Senate bill with amendments. What are the Senate's two main options?  **Answer:**  1. **Concur** - Accept the House amendments (requires 20 votes); bill goes to Governor 2. **Non-concur** - Reject the House amendments; typically leads to requesting a Conference Committee  Question 3: What is a Conference Committee and who serves on it?  **Answer:** A Conference Committee is a joint Senate-House committee created to negotiate a compromise when chambers pass different versions of a bill. It consists of 3 Senators and 3 Representatives appointed by their respective leaders.  Question 4: Can legislators amend a Conference Report?  **Answer:** No. Conference Reports must be voted up or down as written. No amendments are allowed. Each chamber must accept or reject the entire compromise.  Question 5: Senate passes SB 234. House passes SB 234 unchanged. What happens next?  **Answer:** The bill goes directly to the Governor because both chambers have passed identical versions. No concurrence vote or conference committee needed.  Question 6: How many votes are needed for the Senate to concur in House amendments?  **Answer:** 20 votes (majority of 38 Senators), same as for passage of a bill.  Question 7: What's the difference between Senate and House in terms of size and terms?  **Answer:**  - **Senate:** 38 members, 4-year terms - **House:** 110 members, 2-year terms  Question 8: True or False: If the Senate passes a bill, the House is required to give it a hearing and vote on it.  **Answer:** False. The House has complete independence. The House committee chair can decline to schedule a hearing, effectively killing the bill. Each chamber controls its own agenda.  Question 9: A Conference Committee produces a report. Senate adopts it 25-13, but House rejects it 48-62. What happens?  **Answer:** The bill fails (at least temporarily). Both chambers must adopt the Conference Report for the bill to proceed. The chambers could appoint a new conference committee to try again, or the bill dies.  Question 10: Why might the Senate non-concur in House amendments even if the Senate wants the bill to pass?  **Answer:** The Senate may believe the House amendments are unacceptable (change policy too much, reduce funding, add problematic provisions, etc.) and want to negotiate a better compromise through a Conference Committee rather than accepting the House version."},{"location":"modules/06-house-interaction/#practice-scenario-tracking-inter-chamber-movement","title":"Practice Scenario: Tracking Inter-Chamber Movement","text":"<p>You're a Bill Clerk.

A: Fairly common for significant bills. Maybe 10-20% of major bills that pass both chambers require conference committees. Minor bills often pass one chamber and die in the other.</p> <p>Q: What if Conference Committee negotiations fail? A: The bill dies, or a new conference committee is appointed. Sometimes chambers just give up and move on to other priorities.</p> <p>Q: Can the Senate just force the House to pass a bill? A: No. Each chamber is completely independent. The Senate cannot force House action, and vice versa. This is a key feature of bicameralism.</p> <p>Q: Why do chambers sometimes play games with each other's bills? A: Politics, institutional pride, leverage for other negotiations. Each chamber protects its prerogatives and sometimes holds bills hostage to gain concessions on other issues.</p> <p>Q: As a Senate Bill Clerk, do I need to code House actions in detail? A: You code when House messages are received and how Senate responds. You don't code the House's internal process (First Reading, committee, etc.) - just the outcome and Senate's reaction.</p>"},{"location":"modules/06-house-interaction/#key-takeaways","title":"Key Takeaways","text":"<p>\u2705 Both chambers must pass identical versions of bills \u2705 House can pass Senate bill unchanged, with amendments, or not at all \u2705 If House amends Senate bill, Senate votes to concur or non-concur \u2705 Non-concurrence typically leads to Conference Committee \u2705 Conference Committee: 3 Senators + 3 Representatives negotiate compromise \u2705 Conference Report must be adopted by both chambers (no amendments allowed) \u2705 Senate has 38 members; House has 110 members \u2705 Many bills pass one chamber but die in the other \u2705 Bill Clerks track messages from House and Senate's responses  </p>"},{"location":"modules/06-house-interaction/#navigation_1","title":"Navigation","text":"<p>Previous: Module 5: Terminology Back to: Course Home</p> <p>Last Updated: January 2026 for 2025-2026 Legislative Session</p>"},{"location":"practice/scenarios/","title":"Practice Scenarios for Bill Clerks","text":"<p>Purpose: Realistic scenarios to practice coding legislative actions in real-time</p> <p>How to Use: 1.

I've studied the 17 Senate standing committees and understand how bills move between chambers, including the concurrence and conference committee processes.\"</p>"},{"location":"resources/interview-prep/#question-3-describe-a-time-when-you-had-to-maintain-accuracy-while-working-under-pressure","title":"Question 3: \"Describe a time when you had to maintain accuracy while working under pressure.\"","text":"<p>What they're really asking: Can you handle the real-time demands of floor sessions?</p> <p>How to answer: Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)</p> <p>Example Answer: \"As a teacher, I had to grade 120 final exams with a strict deadline while also preparing report cards and attending year-end meetings.

For example, if a bill is placed on Third Reading on a Monday, it's eligible for final vote starting the following Saturday. This gives legislators and the public time to review the bill's final language. The rule can be waived by a 2/3 vote, but that's rare and usually reserved for emergencies.\"</p>"},{"location":"resources/interview-prep/#question-6-explain-the-difference-between-general-orders-and-third-reading","title":"Question 6: \"Explain the difference between General Orders and Third Reading.\"","text":"<p>What they're really asking: Do you understand the floor stages?</p> <p>Example Answer: \"General Orders, also called Committee of the Whole or Second Reading, is the stage where the full Senate debates bills and considers amendments. It's less formal, amendments can be offered freely, and most amendments are decided by voice votes. Third Reading is the final passage stage - very formal, amendments are generally not allowed without special consent, and passage requires a roll call vote with 20 votes to pass. The five-day rule applies to Third Reading. General Orders is where bills are perfected; Third Reading is where they're officially passed.\"</p>"},{"location":"resources/interview-prep/#question-7-how-many-votes-are-needed-to-pass-a-bill-for-immediate-effect","title":"Question 7: \"How many votes are needed to pass a bill?
